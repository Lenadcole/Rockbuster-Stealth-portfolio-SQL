# SQLqueryportfolio

I used SQL to answer a number of business questions posed by the Rockbuster Stealth LLC management team regarding revenue, video rental performance and customer rental habits and locations.

## Who are Rockbuster Stealth LLC?

Rockbuster Stealth is a fictional video rental service that used to have stores in a number of locations across the globe. Now faced with competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, they are looking to break into the online market using existing movie licences in order to stay competitive.

## Context

In order to answer questions posed by the business, I used increasingly complex SQL queries and Tableau visualisations, which can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lena.cole/vizzes). I also created a data dictionary and a presentation containing my findings.
